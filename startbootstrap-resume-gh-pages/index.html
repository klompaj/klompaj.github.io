Studying strategic management in the business school aligns with my passion for understanding how organizations operate effectively.

Balancing married life with academia presents its challenges, but it's a journey of growth that I embrace wholeheartedly. I'm navigating this intersection of faith and education with determination, drawing on the lessons learned from my mission and the opportunities provided by my studies to shape my future with purpose and foresight.</p>
